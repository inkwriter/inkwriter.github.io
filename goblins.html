            <p>Welcome, traveler, to the world of Goblins! The fame you have earned as an avid explorer and feared
                combatant has landed you the task of eradicating an encampment of ruthless goblins that have established
                camp just outside of a gentle little town. The coin is plenty for this task, adventurer, but beware,
                goblins are a nasty bunch known for not fighting fair. Stay on your guard for traps and surprises of all
                kinds. The only thing standing between you and a bag of gold isâ€¦ GOBLINS. Night has fallen. How do you
                want to start your adventure?
            </p>

            <div id="forestLose">
                <p>You go to the forest. You smell smoke and see light in the distance. What do you do?</p>

                <button class="choiceBtn" onclick="goblinsWinFunction()">Go checkout the light</button>
            </div>
            <div id="blacksmith">
                <p>You go to the blacksmith. He gives you a great sword. It should be more than enough to help you take
                    care of the goblins.</p>
                <button class="choiceBtn" onclick="playerWinsFunction()">Venture into the forest</button>
            </div>
            <div id="goblinsWin">
                <p>You step out of the darkness to a small camp of goblins. You are able to defeat one or two with your
                    bare
                    hands, but the remaining overpower you. If only you had a weapon.

            <div id="playerWins">
                <p>You smell smoke and see a light in the distane. You brace your sword for combat and walk toward it
                    with stealth.
                    When you step out of the darkness several goblins attack you, but are no match for your sword. With
                    that bunch
                    of goblins defeated, you wonder if there could be more. There is a cave next to within the reach of
                    the light of
                    the fire, or you can trek deeper into the forest.

            <div id="intoTheWoods">
                <p>You go as deep as you can into the forest until there is nothing but darkness. It wouldn't be
                    pointless to go any
                    further.

            <div id="intoCave">
                <p>You walk into the cave. It is still dimly lit from the fire, but there is a light up a head. What do
                    you do?</p>

                <p>It is a good thing you looked around. You spot a trap that would have crushed you with a giant
                    boulder. You can now
                    go around the trap.

                <p>You step deeper into the cave. You have find a treasure chest full of gold. You have beat the game.
